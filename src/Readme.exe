 I have used two useState one for calculate and other for showing result.As 'result' is used for calculate and 'title'
 used for showing result.

Button ()-In this I'm passing one arguement of title and as you can see under return() in <Button title="title"/>

on Clicking on the button its goes to the calculate() function in which I have passed an arguement i.e. title which matches in the switch 
condition in which it matches the condition or it goes to default case in which I have used useState() hooks for set the value and 
on the other cases as well.
 
 If the user clicks on the '=' or any button then the value of the state will change other wise the value will set int the set.
 
 If the user click on the '=' it calls the calculate() function which has  switch condition matches the cases,under '=' case I have used Number()
 for converting string into number and as I have used eval() which returns  its completion value and set the value in the 'title'.

If the user click on the 'C' it calls the calculate() function which has  switch condition matches the cases,under 'C' case I have used both 
 useState to be empty.

If the user click on the 'DEL' it calls the calculate() function which has  switch condition matches the cases,under 'DEL' case I have  used both 
useState .In which the 'result' to delete the last value from the state and other 'title' to be empty.
